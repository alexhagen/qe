===========================================

This material is very common, so a basic textbook such as (Lamarsh, et.
al. 2001) would have it. For a more physics based approach, a textbook
such as (Krane, 1988) would be good.

Electron Capture
----------------

Electron capture is a process where an orbital electron accelerates into
the nucleus, where it is "captured". The acceleration results in an
X-ray, whos power depends on the :math:`Q` value of electron capture.
Then, the reaction proceeds as

.. math:: \mathrm{\sideset{^{A}_{Z}}{^{*}}X} \rightarrow \mathrm{\sideset{^{A}_{Z-1}}{}Y} + \nu

Internal Conversion
-------------------

Internal conversion is a process where an excited nucleus transfers its
energy to an orbital electron. The energy transfer is monoenergetic
because the excitation levels of a nucleus are quantized. The energy
transfer effected is

.. math:: E_{e^{-}}=E_{ex}-E_{b}

where :math:`E_{b}` is the shell binding energy. The energy transfer
causes the orbital electron to accelerate, which also causes an X-ray.
