====================

The idea of particles having wavelengths is pretty central to a lot of
modern physics, and (Krane, 1988) is a good reference for the idea, but
I would assume that most physics textbooks have this to come degree.

De Broglie hypothesized that every particle is also a wave (and the
converse), and that we could assign them a wavelength depending on their
rest mass and kinetic energy.

Mass Bearing
------------

For mass bearing particles, the pythagorean distance of between the
particle's kinetic energy and rest mass energy is the total energy.
Thus, we can solve the equation

.. math:: E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}

with :math:`h = 4.135\times 10^{-5}\unit{eV\cdot s}` as

.. math:: \lambda = \frac{hc}{\sqrt{E_{total}^{2} - E_{rest}^{2}}}

Non Mass Bearing
----------------

For non mass bearing particles (photons), the rest mass energy is non
sensical, so we get the simple result that

.. math:: \lambda=\frac{hc}{E}
