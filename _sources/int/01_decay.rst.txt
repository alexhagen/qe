=================

This material comes from everywhere, but I guess I'll just say that it
comes from (Lamarsh, et. al. 2001) or (Cember, 2012); both of these are
great introductory texts for Nuclear Engineering.

It seems silly to say, but a lot of graduate nuclear engineers have to
*think* about what decay means what as far as transmutation goes. And we
all know the problems with people thinking... It's important to **know**
the transmutation situations for at least the most common modes of
decay.

Given an atom of isotope :math:`\mathrm{\sideset{^{A}_{Z}}{_{N}}X}`
where :math:`A` is the atomic number, :math:`Z` is the number of
protons, and :math:`N` is the number of neutrons, and :math:`X` is the
atom's symbol, we have the neutron atomic mass
:math:`M\left(Z,A\right)`. We can use the definition
:math:`1\mathrm{amu} \equiv 931.5\mathrm{MeV}` to convert this to our
modified :math:`cgs` units system.

**Positron Decay**

A proton in the nucleus turns into a neutron, emitting a positron
(positively charged particle with mass of an electron) and a neutrino.

.. math:: \mathrm{\sideset{^{A}_{Z}}{_{N}}X \rightarrow \sideset{^{A}_{Z-1}}{_{N+1}}Y + \beta^{+} + \nu}

**Beta Decay**

A neutron in the nucleus turns into a proton, emitting a :math:`\beta`
(negative charged particle with mass of an electron - basically an
electron) and an anti-neutrino.

.. math:: \mathrm{\sideset{^{A}_{Z}}{_{N}}X \rightarrow \sideset{^{A}_{Z+1}}{_{N-1}}Y + \beta^{-} + \overline{\nu}}

**Alpha Decay**

A helium nucleus within the full nucleus is ejected.

.. math:: \mathrm{\sideset{^{A}_{Z}}{_{N}}X \rightarrow \sideset{^{A-4}_{Z-2}}{_{N-2}}Y + \sideset{^{4}_{2}}{_{2}}\alpha}
