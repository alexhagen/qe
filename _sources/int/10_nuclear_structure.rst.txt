=================

Understanding of nuclear structure is fundamental to all detection work,
but there are a couple heuristics that can be used. This material is
common, so I'll use

as expected.

Constant Density Nucleus
------------------------

A common estimate for the radius of a nucleus is

.. math:: R\approx1.25\left[\unit{fm}\right]\cdot A^{\nicefrac{1}{3}}

 which indicates constant density of nucleii. Also, it should be noted
that the :math:`\left(\,\right)^{\nicefrac{1}{3}}` indicates a not very
strong dependence on the number of nucleons, and thus all atoms with
several shells are close to :math:`2\times10^{-10}\unit{m}`

Nuclear Models
--------------

The Shell Model uses the Pauli exclusion principle that states that
there are :math:`2j+1` possible states for substates with total momentum
:math:`j`, That there are orbits, and that magic numbers correspond to
closed shells in both :math:`N` and :math:`Z`.

The liquid drop model states that nucleons are arranged like the
molecules of a spherical liquid drop. This gives way to the expression
for the mass being

.. math::

   \begin{multline*}
   M=NM_{n}+ZM_{p}-\alpha A+\beta A^{\nicefrac{2}{3}}+\gamma\frac{Z^{2}}{A^{\nicefrac{1}{3}}}\\
   +\xi\frac{\left(A-2Z\right)}{A}+\delta
   \end{multline*}

 where :math:`\alpha` is the total volumetric correction or the total
energy of one bond, :math:`\beta` is the surface tension correction,
:math:`\gamma` is the columbic term from potential energy, :math:`\xi`
is the symmetry term, and stronger for :math:`Z=N`, and :math:`\delta`
is a pairing term - indicating that the bond between :math:`n+n` or
:math:`p+p` is stronger than :math:`n+p`.
