=================

One important aspect of materials science as it relates to nuclear
energy is the range or stopping power of a material. This is a
straightforward integration determination, however the knowledge of the
dependencies will help you determine relative differences in materials.
The textbook I learned it from was [Nastasi1996].

The calculation of the range of a particle is defined by the integral
from the incident energy to zero of the reciprocal of its energy
deposition function.

.. math:: R=\int_{E_{i}}^{0} \frac{dE}{\nicefrac{dE}{dx}}

In general, the nuclear energy deposition follows the equation

.. math:: \left.\frac{dE}{dx}\right|_{n}=N_{\Pi} \frac{Z_{1}^{2}Z_{2}^{2}e^{4}M_{1}}{E_{i}M_{2}} \ln \frac{\Lambda E_{i}}{E_{a}}

and the electrical energy deposition is

.. math:: \left.\frac{dE}{dx}\right|_{e}=\frac{dE}{k\sqrt{E_{i}}}
