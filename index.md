# Purdue Nuclear Engineering Qualification Exams Study Material
By Alex Hagen

The Purdue nuclear engineering department requires that any PhD student first pass a complex qualification exam process. The qualification exams include 4 different written exams, an oral exam, and an examination paper.  The student has 2 tries each to pass these exams.  The written topics are:

* Materials
* Interactions
* Neutronics
* [Thermal Hydraulics](https://github.com/alexhagen/qe/tree/master/Thermal_Hydraulics)

I used/created the information in this repository to pass my qualification exams (TH still pending) during the years 2013-2015 (petitioned for 3rd chance at TH).  I hope you in some way find it useful.Updated
