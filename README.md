Alex Hagen | PhDNE - 2017 (hopefully!)

What follows is the product of two years of work and collaboration from several
students around the department, all of which successfully completed their PhDNE
qualifying exams.  The cornerstone of the material is ~50 "tutorials", which are
one page white papers on very specific topics that *were* favorite topics on the
qualifying exams during the time of writing (2012-2015).  I also include study
guides, which are simply cursory coverage of the textbooks assigned, and I may
provide "example problems", which are similar to problems that have been asked
on past exams.  My goal is to provide **directed**, sound, and comprehensive
advice on what to study and how in depth to go, as well as to provide more
material (in the way that Texas A&M has) for students studying for the exam.  I
feel that directing students as they prepare will make the students better
engineers. I, for one, feel I am a better engineer for having learned to pass
the Purdue PhDNE qualification exams.

## Tutorials

These tutorials were the corner stone of my studying for qualification exams.  I
intend them to be used as *extended* flashcards.  I personally copied each of
the tutorials below $15\times$ as a way to memorize them, and that worked
incredibly well. It may have been that I had to pour over material to generate
the tutorials, but still, I think it's a good tactic.
