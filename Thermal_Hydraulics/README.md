## 1. Introduction

The thermal hydraulics exam is often considered the hardest exam.  The department lists the topics of this exam to be ([Purdue Nuclear Engineering, 2014](https://engineering.purdue.edu/NE/Academics/Graduate/Qualifying%20Exam/Qualifying%20Exam%20Briefing%20(2014).pdf)):

> 1. Introduction to Nuclear Thermal-hydraulics Systems
> 2. General Balance Equation
> 3. Single-Phase Flow Conservation Equations and Constitutive Relations
> 4. Non-dimensional Analysis and Scaling Parameters
> 5. Heat Conduction in Solid
> 6. Viscous Stress and Laminar Flow Velocity Profile
> 7. Transient Diffusion Problem for Momentum and Energy and Penetration Depth Concept
> 8. Turbulent Flow Formulation and Reynolds Stress
> 9. Viscous and Turbulent Stress Distribution in Pipe Flow
> 10. Prandtl Mixing Length Model and Universal Velocity Profile for Turbulent Flow
> 11. Prandtl Number Effect on Temperature Profile in Turbulent Flow
> 12. One Dimensional Formulation and Closure Relations 
> 13. Forced Convection Transient Flow Analysis using Integral Momentum Equation
> 14. Natural Circulation Flow Analysis using Integral Momentum Equation
> 15. Control Volume Analysis for Nuclear Reactor System and Application to Various Accident Analyses
> 16. Two-phase Flow Regimes and Boiling Flow Regimes in Terms of Heat Transfer
> 17. Local Instant Formulation of Two-phase Flow Based on Single-Phase Flow Formulation and Jump Conditions
> 18. Basic Concept and Parameters in Two-phase Flow such as Void Fraction
> 19. Derivation of Two-phase Flow Equations Based on Averaging 
> 20. Closure Relations and Correlations for Two-phase Flow

These topics come from the classes NUCL 350, NUCL 351, NUCL 355, NUCL 402, and NUCL 551, with **NUCL 551** being the largest amount of material.

The difficulty becomes decyphering which of the years of each class the material will come from.  Likely, NUCL 350 and NUCL 351 material will come from when Dr. Hibiki taught the class, NUCL 355 and NUCL 402 material will come from when Dr. Revankar taught the class, and NUCL 551 material will come from when Dr. Ishii taught the class.
