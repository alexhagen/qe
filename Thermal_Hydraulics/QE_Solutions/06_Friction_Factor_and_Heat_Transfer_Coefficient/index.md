Friction Factor
===============

The changes in the friction factor are given by the moody chart:

Heat Transfer Coefficient
=========================

The heat transfer coefficient can be found from the Nusselt number,
because $Nu\equiv\frac{hD}{k}$. For laminar flow, this is given as:

-   Laminar Flow $$Nu=4.364$$ [^1]

-   Turbulent Flow - the Dittus-Boelter Correlation

    -   Heating $$Nu=0.026Re^{0.8}Pr^{0.4}$$

    -   Cooling $$Nu=0.026Re^{0.8}Pr^{0.3}$$

[^1]: Assuming constant $q^{''}$ and a circular cross section
