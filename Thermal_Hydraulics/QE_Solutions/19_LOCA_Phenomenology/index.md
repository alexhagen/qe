LOCA occurs in the primary loop

-   High Pressure flashing to steam

-   Without ECCS, core uncovers, melts

-   Exothermic reactions with the air create $\ce{H_{2}}$

-   Core then can melt through the reactor pressure vessel, or even
    containment

but if the eccs turns on, then

-   Passive ECCS provides water into cold legs because of pressure
    reversal across check valve

-   Active ECCS turns on

    -   High Pressure Injection System (HPIS) pushes through a chemical
        shim into cold legs

    -   Low Pressure Injection System (LPIS) continuously cycles water
        through sump, cold legs, and a HEX for heat removal

-   Containment keeps in the gasses and vapor below $45\,\mathrm{psi}$
    and condenses with sprays

### Small Break

-   Pressure relief valves push steam to suppression pool and
    depressurize the system

### Large Break

-   Rapid depressuization due to blowdown

-   ECCS on

-   Low Pressure Core Spray (LPCS) pushes water from pressure pool to
    above the core always keeping it covered

    -   Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) pushes water in to
        recirculations loops from pool

-   All water drains to suppression pool, so there is a continuous
    coolant supply

Critical (Choked) Flow
----------------------

Flow where no more velocity can be obtained from more upstream pressure
or less backpressure

### Single Phase

$$\frac{d\dot{m}}{dp}=0$$
$$\left(\frac{d\dot{m}}{dp}\right)_{cr}=VA\frac{dp}{d\rho}+pA\frac{dV}{d\rho}=0$$

$$G_{cr}^{2}=\rho^{2}\frac{dp}{d\rho}=-\frac{dp}{d\nu}$$

$$c^{2}=\left(\frac{dp}{d\rho}\right)_{s}$$

### Two Phase

$$G_{cr}=\begin{cases}
0.61\sqrt{2\rho_{f}\left(p_{0}-p_{b}\right)} & \nicefrac{L}{D}=0\\
0.61\sqrt{2\rho_{f}\left(p_{0}-p_{cr}\right)} & 0<\nicefrac{L}{D}<3\\
\frac{h_{fg}}{v_{fg}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{T_{cf}}} & \nicefrac{L}{D}\geq3
\end{cases}$$

and if it is subcooled, using the equation above and

$$G_{cr}=\sqrt{2\left[p_{0}-p\left(T_{0}\right)\right]\rho_{l}+G_{erm}^{2}}$$
