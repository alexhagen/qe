# NUCL 402 Solutions

Lamarsh Introduction to Nuclear Engineering

Homeworks 1, 2, and 3 involved the neutron economy of a reactor and not thermal dynamics, so Homework 4 only provides sample questions for this exam:

- [x] PWR Power Density
- Resistance heating model
- [x] PWR channel temperature profile
- [x] heat transfer coefficients in BWR
- [ ] ~~quality with drift-flux~~
- [x] pressure drop accross channel
- [ ] ~~steam explosion scoping~~
- [ ] ~~critical flow~~
- gaussian plumes
- accident comparison
- [x] compare bwr and pwr
- [x] safety systems
